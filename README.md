This my DSA mastery journey.

We'll start with Basic Data-Structures
Array, Linked List, Stack
Then move to advanced DS
Queues, Trees, Graph

Old/New question will be adding here on reqular basis
So keep learning & keep hustling, this is going to be really hard.
Finally remember its a marathon not race.
