/*
 * Leetcode - 857
 * Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers
 * 
 * There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays `quality` and `wage` where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker
 * and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
 * 
 * We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, 
 * we must pay them according to the following rules:
 * 
 * 1. Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
 * 2. In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. 
 *   This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, 
 *   then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.

 * Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.
 * Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 * Example 1
 * input       : quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], k = 2
 * output      : 105.0000
 * Explanation : We pay 70 to 0th worker and 35 to 2nd worker.

 * Example 2
 * input       : quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], k = 3
 * output      : 30.66667
 * Explanation : We pay 4 to 0th worker, 13.33333 to 2nd and 3rd workers separately.
